Toggle silent running on or off. While
enabled, the shield system will
automatically shut down and all heat
radiators are disabled to ensure the
ship has a near-zero signature. A low
signature will prevent others from
detecting the ship on their sensors.
However, with no radiators enabled,
heat will build up within the ship and
can reach dangerous levels.
