This will engage the FSD to either
hyperspacejump to another system if it
has been target locked, or supercruise
if there is no target or a current system
target is locked instead. While
supercruising, it will exit to normal
space as long as another star system
hasn't been targeted in the meantime,
in which case it will hyperspace jump to
that star system.
