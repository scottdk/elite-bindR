Sets how to handle head movement
with an Axis:

Accumulate will move the head in the
direction and speed based on the input
but will remain fixed in that direction
once input is stopped.

Direct maps the input to the direction
with a neutral input representing
straight ahead and full input resulting
in a fully rotated view in the direction
the input corresponds to.
